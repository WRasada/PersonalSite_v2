This site will be utilizing the MEAN stack; however, to start it will not have any Angular. Angular will be used later on as I continue to learn.

Current list of packages:

"body-parser": "^1.16.1",
"connect-flash": "^0.1.1",
"ejs": "^2.5.6",
"express": "^4.14.1",
"express-session": "^1.15.1",
"method-override": "^2.3.7",
"mongoose": "^4.8.4",
"passport": "^0.3.2",
"passport-local": "^1.0.0",
"passport-local-mongoose": "^4.0.0"

will update as I add more.
