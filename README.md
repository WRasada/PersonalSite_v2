This site will be utilizing the MEAN stack; however, to start it will not have any Angular. Angular will be used later on as I continue to learn.

Current list of packages:

 - body-parser
 - connect-flash
 - ejs
 - express
 - express-session
 - method-override
 - mongoose
 - passport
 - passport-local
 - passport-local-mongoose

will update as I add more.
